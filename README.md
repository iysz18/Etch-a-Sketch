# Etch-a-Sketch
A simple browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.
Utilizing the `div` element in HTML to display `pixels`


## What's coming soon:


* Implementing a progressively darkening effetct where each interaction adds 10% more black or color to the square. The objective is to achieve a completely black square only after ten interactions.

* Option to disable/enable the outlines of the pixels

* Implement the support for touchscreens (smartphones, tablets ...)


## What's done:
* [X] Prompt to enter a desired grid dimension between 0 - 100.
 
* [X] Replace the automatic popup prompt with a button for selecting the grid dimensions, allowing the users to specify both the X and Y dimensions of the grid.

* [X] User can choose any color he wants to increase the experience with Etch-a-Sketch.

* [X] Rather than a color change from black to white, each interaction should randomize 
the pixel's RGB value entirely.

* [X] Introducing an erase button desigend to remove the color of each pixel.

* [X] Adding an infomative text saying "Click on generate to create a blank canvas" or something similar which is placed in the center of the canvas. By clicking on the generate button the empty canvas gets revealed to the user. Same text appears when the user decides to reset the grid size.
