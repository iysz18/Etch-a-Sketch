# Etch-a-Sketch
A simple browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.
Utilizing the `div` element in HTML to display `pixels`

## What's coming soon:
* Adding a watermark text saying "Etch-a-Sketch" which covers the canvas. By clicking on the empty canvas it gets revealed to the user.

* Implementing a progressively darkening effetct where each interaction adds 10% more black or color to the square. The objective is to achieve a completely black square only after ten interactions.

* Rather than a color change from black to white, each interaction should randomize the pixel's RGB value entirely.


## What's done:
* [X] User get prompt to enter a desired grid dimension (less or equal to 100).

* [X] Replace the automatic popup prompt with a button for selecting the grid dimensions, allowing the users to specify both the X and Y dimensions of the grid.

* [X] User can choose any color he wants to increase the experience with Etch-a-Sketch.
